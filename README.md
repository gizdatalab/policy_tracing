# The Problem
Worlds main problem is the progressing climate change and too few efforts to stop it. The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in 2021 was filled with promises of governmental action to help tackle climate change. The national adaptation and mitigation goals are laid down in the nationally determined contribution
(NDC). 
Example NDC from South Africa: [NDC South Africa](https://www.dffe.gov.za/sites/default/files/docs/southafricasINDCupdated2021sept.pdf)
Excample Policy Document: [National REDD SA](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236347801_South_Africa's_national_REDD_initiative_Assessing_the_potential_of_the_forestry_sector_on_climate_change_mitigation)

# Project Goal
The goal of the policy implementation tracing is to connect local NDCs with Policy Documents to check if the goals are realised.
