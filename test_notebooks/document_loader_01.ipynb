climate change impacts and the associated socioeconomic losses the situation is exacerbated by the high dependence on climate sensitive natural resourcesin response to the challenges posed by climate change kenya has developed a national climate change response strategy nccrs national climate change action plan nccap and a national adaptation plan nap under preparation which provides a vision for low carbon and climate resilient development pathway while a national climate change framework policy and legislation are in their final stages of enactment to facilitate effective response to climate changekenya is operationalising these policies and plans through the implementation of climate change actions in various areas such as afforestation and reforestation geothermal and other clean energy development energy efficiency climate smart agriculture and drought management this document presents kenya s intended nationally determined contribution indc in response to decisions adopted at the th and th sessions of the conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc that invite parties to communicate to the secretariat their indcs towards achieving the objective of the unfccc as set out in article of the conventionkenya s indc builds on the participatory multistakeholder and crosssectoral consultative processes during the development of nccrs and nccap at national and county levels the contribution will also contribute towards the delivery of the constitution of kenya and the attainment of vision the country s development blueprint national circumstances kenya is located in the greater horn of africa region which is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change more than of the country s landmass is arid and semiarid land asal with poor infrastructure and other developmental challenges the country s economy is highly dependent on climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture that is mainly rainfed energy tourism water and healthclimate hazards have caused considerable losses across the country s different sectors over the years the main climate hazards include droughts and floods which cause economic losses estimated at of the country s gross domestic product gdp kenya s total greenhouse gas ghg emissions are relatively low standing at mtco eq in out of which are from the land use landuse change and forestry lulucf and agriculture sectors this may be explained by the reliance on wood fuel by a large proportion of the population coupled with the increasing demand for agricultural land and ministry of environment and natural resources urban developmentthe other significant emissions are from the energy and transport sectors with the waste and industrial processes contributing negligible amounts kenya strives to be a newly industrialised middle income country by this development is expected to increase emissions from the energy sector the current energy mix however is mainly clean with deliberate efforts by government towards enhancing geothermal wind solar and other clean energy development climate change impacts continue to slow down the attainment of its national development goals kenya will continue making investments with both domestic and international resources to adapt to climate change and realise its abatement potentialscontribution kenya s indc includes both mitigation and adaptation components based on her national circumstances and in line with decisions cp and cp mitigation kenya aims to achieve a low carbon climate resilient development pathway kenya seeks to undertake an ambitious mitigation contribution towards the kenya will continue to implement the agreement kenya therefore seeks to abate its nccap and subsequent ghg emissions by by relative to action plans beyond this period to the bau scenario of mtco eq and in achieve this target this will include the line with its sustainable development agendapromotion and implementation of the this is also subject to international support in following mitigation activities the form of finance investment technology development and transfer and capacity expansion in geothermal solar and wind

transition model consistent with the revised ipcc guidelines was used to calculate fluxes of co to or from the atmosphere and biomass carbon pools is the same as outlined in the revised ipcc guidelines there is significant uncertainty in the bau emission and mitigation potential estimates for this sector and work is underway to update and improve these estimates contribution of kenya does

bau projection contained in the nccap and snc has been revised to be consistent with the current level of geothermal deployment since the nccap was publishedadaptation as a minimal contributor to

further kenya will ensure enhanced resilience to climate change towards the attainment of elaborated in the nap the actions are based on risk and vulnerability assessments across vision by mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the medium term the mtp sectors many of the actions have strong synergies with mitigation actions plans mtps and implementing adaptation kenya s capacity
